Effect is implemented with multiple stacked `Grid`s, `VisualBrush`, and `TranslateTransform`:

- Static layer with background solid color
- Static layer with large squares
- Animated layer of square-in-squares that move left and up
- Animated layer of square-in-squares that move right and down

Thanks to [Starlk](https://github.com/starlkyt) for `Margin` suggestion to remove a grid resizing hack
