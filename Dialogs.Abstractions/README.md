This project contains abstractions for implementing a MVVM-friendly dialog system. The types are not coupled to any View, so the View will need to implement them for the particular UI framework. `DialogViewModel` is coupled to Mvvm Toolkit.

See [Dialogs.Todo](/Dialogs.Todo) for an example project.
